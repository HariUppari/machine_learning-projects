Introduction

This project focuses on dominant color extraction from images using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The aim is to identify the most prominent colors in an image, which can be useful for various applications such as color-based image classification, palette generation, and image segmentation. Key techniques used in this project include:

- Image Preprocessing - Preparing images for clustering by converting them into a suitable format for analysis (e.g., reshaping and normalizing pixel values).
- K-Means Clustering - Applying the K-Means algorithm to group similar pixel values into a specified number of clusters, where each cluster represents a dominant color.
- Color Centroid Calculation - Determining the centroids of each cluster, which represent the dominant colors in the image.
- Visualization - Displaying the original image along with its extracted dominant colors, providing a clear visual representation of the results.
- Performance Analysis - Adjusting the number of clusters to observe how it affects the extracted dominant colors and the overall accuracy of color representation.

The project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms like K-Means can be used to process images and extract meaningful information such as dominant colors. This approach is commonly used in image processing, computer vision, and design fields to analyze and manipulate color data.
