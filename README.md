## machine_learning-projects/Dominant Color Extraction using K-Means Algorithm

Introduction

This project focuses on dominant color extraction from images using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The aim is to identify the most prominent colors in an image, which can be useful for various applications such as color-based image classification, palette generation, and image segmentation. Key techniques used in this project include:

- Image Preprocessing - Preparing images for clustering by converting them into a suitable format for analysis (e.g., reshaping and normalizing pixel values).
- K-Means Clustering - Applying the K-Means algorithm to group similar pixel values into a specified number of clusters, where each cluster represents a dominant color.
- Color Centroid Calculation - Determining the centroids of each cluster, which represent the dominant colors in the image.
- Visualization - Displaying the original image along with its extracted dominant colors, providing a clear visual representation of the results.
- Performance Analysis - Adjusting the number of clusters to observe how it affects the extracted dominant colors and the overall accuracy of color representation.

The project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms like K-Means can be used to process images and extract meaningful information such as dominant colors. This approach is commonly used in image processing, computer vision, and design fields to analyze and manipulate color data.

## machine_learning-projects/Hypothesis Testing on Sales Data

Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting sales data using a combination of statistical techniques and machine learning models. The primary aim is to derive insights about key factors influencing sales and to build predictive models using linear regression and random forest algorithms. In addition to machine learning, various statistical tests are performed to validate assumptions and understand data distributions. The key techniques involved in this project include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Summarizing and visualizing key aspects of the sales dataset to understand the underlying patterns and relationships.
- Hypothesis Testing - Utilizing statistical tests such as:
  - T-tests for comparing means between groups.
  - ANOVA for analyzing variance across multiple groups.
  - Shapiro-Wilk Test and Q-Q plots for checking data normality.
  - Durbin-Watson Test for detecting autocorrelation in residuals.
  - Kruskal-Wallis Test for non-parametric comparison across groups.
- Linear Regression - A statistical method to model the relationship between sales and various independent variables, providing insights into the linear relationships.
- Random Forest Regression - A powerful machine learning algorithm used to model non-linear relationships and improve prediction accuracy by creating an ensemble of decision trees.
- Feature Scaling - Applying techniques such as standardization to prepare the data for machine learning models.
- Model Evaluation - Evaluating the performance of models using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared to determine how well the models predict sales.
- Interpretation of Results - Analyzing model coefficients and feature importance to understand the factors driving sales.

This project highlights the integration of statistical analysis and machine learning to provide both descriptive insights and predictive capabilities for sales data. It offers a robust framework for improving decision-making in sales strategy and forecasting.
